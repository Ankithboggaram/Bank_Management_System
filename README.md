# Bank Management System

We have made a simple bank management system. Our goal while making this project was to familiarize ourself with the different
architecture and design patterns which are available when we are working with college. We have chosen to work with Singleton design pattern, and the MVC architecture pattern
These are the most basic patterns we have at our disposal, and working with them on this project opened a world of possibilities to us.
